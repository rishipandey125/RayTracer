/*
Here is how the disk DOF works: for every point in the disk - treat that like a pinhole camera.
That means you have a ton of pinhole cameras in a disk. Each pinhole camera can shoot rays and create an image.
If those images are averaged together then everything - but the thing in the focus point will be out of focus.
This is because we are looking at objects from different views a bunch of times and then averaging those views.
This is what causes the blurriness. There is only one thing in focus because all the pinhole cameras are told to look at
one thing. This Allows us to create a depth of field. The larger the apeture (lower the f-stop) the more pinhole cameras
you have. This means that there will be a higher depth of field because things not in focus will be blurrier.
