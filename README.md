# Ray Tracer
Ray Tracer built in C++ to further develop my understanding of core computer graphics principles. I learned how to build this project by reading Peter Shirleyâ€™s Ray Tracing in One Weekend book. It features global illumination lighting of diffuse, metallic, and dielectric materials and camera controls for basic cinematography.
